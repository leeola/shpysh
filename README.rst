ShPySh
======

ShPysh is a "shell" *(And i do use the term loosely)* written with the goal
of making a shell that is both usable and fun to script in. Again it is
designed to be enjoyable. Bash and Zsh, while great to use, are horrendous
when scripted in. Good lord, it looks worse than perl.. which is hard to do
*(i kid i kid)*. At any rate, because of this we are going to sacrifice speed
and memory footprint. It will never be suitable for a highend server that
needs every ounce of memory space possible. This thing will be big, It will
be slow, and most likely it will even be shitty. You have been warned.

The Name
--------
The name stands for **Sh** itty **Py** thon **Sh** ell. Why the self mocking
name when it, *if implemented properly,* is so utterly awesome? Because the
author has no idea what he is doing in regards to Shell design. There is no
way this can turn out good. For the love of god, turn around now, as this will
most likely eat your babies.

Features
--------
The only thing planned at the moment, is pure awesome.. and memory bloat.
